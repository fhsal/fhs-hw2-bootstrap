Summary of work:

> updated nav bar for all three pages so the content has my name and the links work from page-to-page.  

> added a second set of images to the Portfolio page and replaced the placeholders with photos.  created a third column to do that in the same row

> updated the Contact page to have a better card with a photo and several sections.  centered the card with the bootstrap controls. 

>I will continue to try and get the colors to change - didn't have time to figure that out and could change some of them but wasn't satisfied with the result.  I mistakenly was working on next week's assignment rather than this one so ran out of time :)
